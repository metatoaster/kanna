# Kanna ASCII art bleeder script

Reddit user /u/2hu4u was inspired by the ascii art bleeding found in the
opening of the anime Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon Kanna and
recreated one based on that, then someone in the thread
[mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5uxjn4/i_recreated_the_kanna_ascii_art_from_kobayashisan/ddxpkga/)
how this needs to be done in Python... and so here it is.  Only tested
this under Linux for now with a wide enough terminal (with small fonts).

Clone this repository, then run it by calling the file.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/metatoaster/kanna
$ cd kanna
$ clear  # clear the screen for best effect (Ctrl-L works too)
$ python asciibleed.py kanna.txt
```

Naturally, the original art was done by /u/2hu4u so thank that user
otherwise this wouldn't have been possible.
